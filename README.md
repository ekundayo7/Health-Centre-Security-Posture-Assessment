# Health-Centre-Security-Posture-Assessment
A practical evaluation of the security posture of a health care center, assessing governance, risks, compliance and security controls to identify vulnerabilities and recommend improvements aligned with organization's goals, security best practices and industry wide recognized laws and regulation.

## Objective
- Evaluate data security and privacy.
- Assess risk.
- Develop a plan for backup.
- Apply file and drive encryption.

## Organization Profile
- Organization type: Healthcare Centre
- Data handled: Patient personal and medical data. medical records, staff information.
- Environment: On premise system with internet access, backups are stored on external hard disks.

## Scope of assessment
Included
- Review of existing data privacy and protection policies.
- Review of backup and data retention policies.
- Identification of security and privacy risks.
- Review of policies and recommendations in alignment with appropriate healthcare data protection regulation.

## Governace and Compliance Review
### Policies and documentation 
The organization maintains documented information security policies however some policies require review and updates to align with the regulatory requirements.
### Roles & Responsibilities
There are no defined roles and responsibilties for data protection; this requires urgent attention.
### Regulatory Awareness & Compliance
The organization shows awareness of healthcare data protection policies but compliance could be improved.
### Training & Awareness
Staffs are regularly trained on data privacy and data handling practices however they are no strict policies to guarantee compliance.

## Security Control Assessment
The healthcare centre has no access contol mechanism in place to restrict unauthorized access to patient data. Reliance on external hard disk backup without encryption poses a potential data loss risk.

## Risk Identification
|Risk Type       | Description                                                                 | Impact on Organization                                        |
|Security Risk   | Unauthorized access to patient medical records due to weak access control   |Reach of patient confidentiality, potential legal penalties    |
|Compliance  Risk| Lack of compliance of internal policies with healthcare data protection regulations.| Potential Legal & financial penalties                  |
|Operational Risk| Loss of criticaal data due to unsecured external hard disk backup           | Disruption of healthcare services, loss of critical pateient data|

## Reccommendation
- Implement role based access control for patient records and enforce sstong passwords.
- Full disk encryption should be carried out hard disk backup and systems in the healthcare centre
- Conduct regular policy review to ensure alignments withe healthcare data protection regulations

## What I Learned
- Improved understanding of security posture assessments.
- Exposure to risk identification in healthcare environment.
- Strengthened Data privacy and GRC skills.
- Understanding of effects of lack of data integrity to the organization
